 Several R scripts or Python scripts
1.
To obtain an attractive visual representation of all the data in the dataset. With visual interactive elements to support the socalled 
Visualisation mantra:

Overview: Gain an overview of the entire collection

Zoom : Zoom in on items of interest 

Filter: filter out interesting items or filter in interesting items

Details: on demand: Select an item or group and get relevant information accordingly
2.
To simulate big data and RAM problems, additional libraries are used
o
In case of R , for instance the library FFBASE 
3.
All of the  dataset is stored in a NOSQL database, for instance MONGODB
. A live connection to filter data during the process of running
the script should be implemented:
o
There should be a collection containing all of the data of the Kaggle dataset having the following structure
i.
Hotel_Address text,
ii.
Hotel_Name text,
iii.
 Lat double,
iv.
 Lng double,
v.
 Average_Score double,

vi.
 Total_Number_of_Reviews int,
vii.
 Additional_Number_of_Scoring int,
viii.
  Reviewer_Nationality text,
ix.
  Review_Date text,
x.
  Review text,
xi.
  Review_Word_Counts int,
xii.
  Total_Number_of_Reviews_Reviewer_Has_Given int,
xiii.
  Reviewer_Score double,
xiv.
  Tags text,
xv.
  Sentiment int, additional field indicating a positive Review 1, or a negative review 0
o
There should be a collection of balanced set of reviews, for instance a collection consisting of 10.000 positive and 10.000 
negative reviews having a least the following structure
i.
Review text,
ii.
Sentiment int
4.
At least one more or less advanced feature should be implemented.
i.
Either the student simulates parallel processing power. For example, a sentiment analysis of the hotel reviews is solved 
by using Spark.
ii.
Or the student demonstrates state-of -the-art algorithms. For example, a prediction on the sentiment of a review using 
the length of the review be built using Keras

A compact report
 , meeting the following requirements , the report should be
1.
In correct English or Dutch
2.
Containing relevant screenshots of codes 
3.
Containing relevant screenshots of the visualisation
4.
Clarify the process of Model Building
a.
What kind of Machine Learning algorithm was used? 
b.
Why was it needed?
5.
Communicating the result
